Regardless from where you get the program, for the Time2 problem, use the one in the book (8.5) and modify it
(leave everything the same except...) to have the new methods tick(), incrementMinute(), incrementHour().  
Save it as Time2.java.  

Use it to make your test program, say Time2Test.java, to test the new methods.  
Zip those files together and submit.

For Date, do the same.  Use the one given, modify it appropriately, make your test program, zip and submit.  


You are correct.  
As the exercise states, you will modify the existing Time2 class to contain 
the methods tick(), incrementMinute() and incrementHour().  
You can modify the test program listed in chapter 8 to test your new methods by making objects of 
the Time2 class with appropriate time settings and calling tick().

For the Date class modification download the version of the Date class posted 
in Angel and add the nextDay() method to it.  
Test the nextDay() method in a test program.
